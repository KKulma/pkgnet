### Resubmission on January 2nd, 2019
>Hello, 
>
>I hope you had a refreshing holiday break. 
>
>Apologies for the past issues with this build.  I believe we have remedied the functionality that did not pass i386 tests.  However, I cannot confirm this as the last submission alsopassed R CMD check on R-devel without issue.  Is there a separate docker container I can use to check i386 compatibility?   
>
>This submission passes R CMD check tests on r-devel with two warnings regarding URLs that fail within the container but have been confirmed valid and pass on R CMD check on R-core outside the container. 
>
>Here is the version info: 
```
